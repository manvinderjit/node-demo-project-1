# node-demo-project-1

This is a node demo project created by me while following the course `Building a Website with Node.js and Express.js` by Daniel Khan available on LinkedIn learning at the following link

## Branches

Branches `feat/exercise#` were created at the end of each exercise or unit of the course. 

The branch `final-course` was pushed at the end of the course and containes the same, in addition to the github actions workflow. 

Branches beyond that (`feat/custom#`) will contain custom features implmented by me that were not covered in the course.

## Additional Features Implementation

In addition to the course content, I will be implementing additional features in the project

### Already Implemented

1. A github actions workflow that lints on every push request to the github repository

### Upcoming

1. Instead of using a json file for data, use a database (MySQL) and implement an ORM (Sequelizer)

2. Add a login page and require users to login before they can post feedbacks
